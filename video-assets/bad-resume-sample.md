## Why This Resume Scores Low:

### Major Issues:
1. **Generic Objective** - Says nothing specific
2. **Vague Job Descriptions** - "Responsible for marketing tasks"
3. **No Quantified Achievements** - No numbers, metrics, or results
4. **Weak Action Verbs** - "Helped," "Assisted," "Did"
5. **Generic Skills** - "Hard worker," "Team player"
6. **No Keywords** - Missing industry-specific terms
7. **Poor Formatting** - Basic structure, no visual hierarchy
8. **No LinkedIn/Portfolio** - Missing professional links
9. **Outdated References Line** - Wastes space

### Missing Elements:
- Professional summary instead of objective
- Specific achievements with numbers
- Industry keywords and technical skills
- Professional formatting
- Contact information optimization
- Relevant certifications or projects

This resume would trigger multiple red flags in Resume Roaster's analysis system and provide plenty of material for the "brutal truth" reveal in the video.
