# Cache Bypass Feature

## Overview
The Resume Roaster application now includes a cache bypass feature that allows users to force regenerate optimized resumes without using cached data.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when users clicked "Generate Optimized Version", the system would always use cached data if available, which could lead to:
- Stale optimization results
- Inability to get fresh AI-generated content
- Frustration when users wanted to try different optimization approaches

## Solution
Added a "Force Regenerate (Bypass Cache)" button that:
- Bypasses both local storage cache and database cache
- Forces fresh AI processing for resume optimization
- Provides clear user feedback about the cache bypass process

## How It Works

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Button**: Added a "Force Regenerate" button that only appears when cached data exists
2. **User Confirmation**: Shows a confirmation dialog explaining the cache bypass process
3. **Better Feedback**: Clear visual indicators when cache is being bypassed

### Backend Changes
1. **API Parameter**: Added `bypassCache` parameter to `/api/extract-resume-data` endpoint
2. **Cache Logic**: Modified cache lookup and save logic to respect the bypass flag
3. **Logging**: Enhanced logging to track when cache is bypassed

### Cache Levels Bypassed
1. **Local Storage Cache**: Frontend localStorage cache for extraction data
2. **Database Cache**: Backend database cache for optimized resumes

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Analysis page
2. If cached data exists, you'll see both:
   - "Generate Optimized Version (Fast)" - uses cache
   - "Force Regenerate (Bypass Cache)" - bypasses cache
3. Click "Force Regenerate" to get fresh AI-generated content
4. Confirm the action in the dialog that appears

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (analysis/page.tsx)
```typescript
const handleGenerateOptimized = async (bypassCache: boolean = false) => {
  // ... existing logic with cache bypass support
}
```

### Backend (api/extract-resume-data/route.ts)
```typescript
const { bypassCache = false } = await request.json()

// Skip cache lookup if bypassing
if (!bypassCache) {
  const cachedOptimizedResume = await getOrCreateOptimizedResume(...)
  // ... cache logic
}

// Skip cache save if bypassing
if (!bypassCache) {
  await saveOptimizedResumeToCache(...)
}
```

## Benefits
- Users can get fresh optimization results when needed
- Maintains performance benefits of caching for normal use
- Provides flexibility for different user needs
- Clear user experience with proper feedback

## Future Enhancements
- Add cache bypass option to other optimization features
- Implement cache expiration policies
- Add cache statistics and management tools
